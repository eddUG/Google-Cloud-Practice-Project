# Google Africa Developer Scholarship Phase II: Google Cloud Practice Project

### Description
During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program shall be encouraged to explore the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.

Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight. Learners in the Cloud track have free access to a selection of fundamental labs on GCP

### The challenge(s)
The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:

* Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.
* “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.


## About this repo
This repository is intended to document my attempt of the Google Cloud Practice Project challenge. 

[Qwiklabs Completion status](https://github.com/eddUG/Google-Cloud-Practice-Project/blob/master/Qwiklabs-Completion-status.md) shows evidence of my completion of 14 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs, submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received. 

Finally, repo shows how to use ☁️Google Cloud Platform Cloud Shell to:

* **Establish VPN tunnels between two networks in separate regions such that a VM in one network can ping a VM in the other network over its internal IP address**. This Lab is titled [Virtual Private Networks(VPN)](https://github.com/eddUG/Google-Cloud-Practice-Project/blob/master/Virtual-Private-Networks.md)
<br><br>
* **Configure and test an internal load balancer with two managed instances groups as the backends, as shown in this network diagram:** This Lab is titled [Configuring an Internal Load Balancer](https://github.com/eddUG/Google-Cloud-Practice-Project/blob/master/Configuring-an-Internal-Load-Balancer.md)

This repo is a work in progress, intend to translate tens of labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions. Wish me luck
